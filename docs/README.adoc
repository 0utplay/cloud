== Introduction to Cloud

CAUTION: The Cloud documentation is still a work in progress.

Cloud is a command manager and dispatcher for the JVM. Cloud allows you to define commands in
several ways, most notably using command builders, or annotations. Cloud has platform implementations
for many platforms, including Minecraft server software such as Bukkit or Discord bot frameworks
such as JDA.

Cloud allows you to customize the command execution pipeline by injecting custom behaviour along
the entire execution path. All of this will be covered in this document.

This document will first introduce different Cloud concepts using the builder pattern API.
Section 4 will expand upon this by introducing the annotation (declarative) API, which offers
another way of declaring commands.

== Getting Started

Cloud is available through https://search.maven.org/search?q=cloud.commandframework[Maven Central].

[source,xml,subs="attributes,verbatim"]

<dependency>
    <groupId>cloud.commandframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>cloud-core</artifactId>
    <version>{cloud-version}</version>
</dependency>

If you want to use snapshot builds, then they are available via the Sonatype OSS Snapshot repository:

== Core

=== Command Manager

=== Commands

Commands consist of chains of arguments that are parsed from user input. These arguments
can be either static literals or variables. Variable arguments are parsed into different
types using argument parsers. Variable arguments may be either required, or they can be
optional. Optional arguments may have default values.

[title=Example command structure]
====
[source]
----
/foo bar one
/foo bar two <arg>
/foo <arg> <1>
----
<1> When a variable argument is present next to literals, it will be allowed to catch any
input that isn't caught by the literals. Only one variable may exist at any level, but
there may be many literals.

This example contains three unique commands.
